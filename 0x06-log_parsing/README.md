This project is intended to do log parsing with Python:
    ogs  are  imperative  in  the  development  and  maintenance process of many software
    systems. They record detailed runtime  information  that  allows  developers and
    support  engineers to monitor their systems and dissect anomalous behaviors and  errors.
    The  increasing  scale  and  complexity  of  modern software  systems,  however,  make
    the  volume  of  logs  explodes. In  many  cases,  the  traditional  way  of  manual  log
    inspection becomes  impractical.  Many  recent  studies,  as  well  as  industrial tools,
    resort to powerful text search.
