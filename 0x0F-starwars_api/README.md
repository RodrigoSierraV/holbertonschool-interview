The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and
programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars 
canon universe!

All the data is accessible through our HTTP web API. Consult our documentation
if you'd like to get started.

Helper libraries for popular programming languages are also provided so you can
consume swapi in your favourite programming language, in a style that suits you.
