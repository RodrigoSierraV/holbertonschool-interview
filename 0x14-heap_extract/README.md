Heap is a special case of balanced binary tree data structure where the
root-node key is compared with its children and arranged accordingly.

A max-heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node
is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.

Max Heap Construction Algorithm

Step 1 − Create a new node at the end of heap.
Step 2 − Assign new value to the node.
Step 3 − Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 − If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.
