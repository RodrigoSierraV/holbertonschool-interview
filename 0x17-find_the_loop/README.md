##LinkedList Loop Detection

A loop exists in a LinkedList when no NULL is reached as we traverse
throughout the LinkedList.

Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm

Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm uses two pointers that move at different
speeds. If there is a cycle, both of the pointers would point to the
same value at some point in the future.

Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm is similar to the Tortoise Hair Story.
