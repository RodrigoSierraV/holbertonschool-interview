This project is intended to understand binary trees and binary heaps:

Trees: Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.

Tree Vocabulary: The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its parent. For example, ‘a’ is a child of ‘f’, and ‘f’ is the parent of ‘a’. Finally, elements with no children are called leaves.

A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property. The ordering can be one of two types:

    - the min-heap property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.
    - the max-heap property: the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root.
