The objective of this excercise is to find if a singly linked list is circular or not:
	A circular linked list is a variation of the linked list. It is a linked list whose nodes are connected in such a way that it forms a circle. In the circular linked list, the next pointer of the last node is not set to null but it contains the address of the first node thus forming a circle.
